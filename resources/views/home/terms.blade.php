                            The Platform acts as a facilitator connecting Vendors and Customers. We do not store or handle food directly but coordinate delivery via approved logistics partners, collection at storefronts, and other authorised fulfilment channels. We are not a party to the sale contract between Vendor and Customer.

                            Vendors must maintain valid food business registration and hygiene ratings, list only compliant products, accurately describe items, ensure safe packaging, cooperate with logistics partners, and comply with all relevant laws. Non-compliance may result in account suspension or termination.
