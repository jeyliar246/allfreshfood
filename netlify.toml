# IMPORTANT: Netlify is a static site host and doesn't support PHP.
# Laravel requires PHP to run. Consider these alternatives:
# - Vercel (with PHP support)
# - Railway
# - Heroku
# - DigitalOcean App Platform
# - Traditional shared/VPS hosting (cPanel, etc.)
# - Laravel Forge + DigitalOcean/Linode
